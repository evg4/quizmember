## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created it on 21.08.23 to continue getting familiar with React. With this app I wanted to practise using the useState() hook, specifically with an object, as well as forms. The data submitted does not actually go anywhere.
## How to use
This can be viewed at https://evg4.github.io/quizmember/ Users can fill out the form with their details, which will then appear below. They are asked to confirm, and then the form disappears and new text appears to confirm the registration was successful.
## Credits
I learnt React on Codecademy.
## Licence
Please see license document.
