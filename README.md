## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created it on 21.08.23 to continue getting familiar with React. With this app I wanted to practise using the useState() hook, specifically with an object, as well as forms. The data submitted does not actually go anywhere.
